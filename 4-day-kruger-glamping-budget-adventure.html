                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>If you are looking for an exciting and hassle-free way to explore the wildlife of South Africa, join us on a 4 day safari through the famous Kruger National Park.  You don’t have to worry about planning your travel, accommodation, or meals, as we have everything arranged for you at an affordable price.</p>
                <p>You will enjoy a variety of activities during this safari, such as a sunset drive in a Big 5 Game Reserve, a full day of game viewing in Kruger National Park, a bush walk in the Motlala Reserve, and more. You will have the chance to see and photograph many animals in their natural habitat, such as lions, elephants, leopard and zebra.</p>
                <p>You will stay at the Masango Camp, a cosy wildlife lodge located within the Motlala Game Reserve, only 30 kilometres away from Hoedspruit. The lodge has eight rustic chalets with private bathrooms and air conditioning. You will also get to experience the wildlife up close, as the lodge is visited by buffalo, nyala, impala and giraffe on a regular basis.</p>
                <p><b>Accommodation</b></p>
                <p>The lodge is designed in such a way that it makes guests very close to and part of the natural environment. It features an inviting swimming pool as well as an open boma and barbecue area in addition to indoor dining areas. The communal spaces include a bar, a breakfast nook, a lounge and dining areas. The camp further provides 8 free-standing en suite chalets that each sleeps 2 people. Each chalet is furnished with 1 double bed or 2 x single beds and the en-suite bathroom is fitted with a shower, washbasin and toilet. Units sport an overhead fan, electric lights, and power points, as well as mosquito nets fitted on each bed.</p>

            <!--What to Expect-->
            <div class="toursWhatToExpect">
                <h3>What to Expect</h3>
                <p>You will have ample time to search for the “Big 5” and other animals during several game drives and spend your evenings unwinding in the splendour of your chalet beneath the African night sky after indulging in mouth-watering dinners and stargazing.</p>
                <p>Your itinerary for the 4-day Kruger budget safari is as follows:</p>
                <h4>Day 1</h4>
                <p>You are collected from OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg very early and driven to Masango Lodge near Hoedspruit, where you should arrive around 14:00. You will have time to check in to your chalet and, relax and enjoy the facilities, before you will depart around 15:00 for a 3-hour afternoon game drive in the private game reserve in open safari vehicles. You may already see some famous animals, such as elephants, giraffes, zebra, and antelopes, before returning to camp about 19:00 for a great boma fire lunch and a tranquil night under the stars.</p>
                <h4>Day 2 and 3</h4>
                <p>You’ll wake up early to be ready for a full-day safari into Kruger National Park. Your days may proceed in one of two ways: You can have an early departure for Kruger National Park while predators like lions, leopards, cheetahs, and hyenas are still active and see the sunrise over the park, with a bush breakfast along the route and an earlier return, or you can first have breakfast at the lodge, departing and returning later.</p>
                <p>The exact departure times for every day will be communicated to you the night before as it will be decided according to animal activity at the time to give you the best opportunity for game viewing. Your full day safari will last 7 to 8 hours, so you should be back at the camp with enough time to relax before dinner by the fire. You can enjoy dinner under the stars (with a complimentary glass of wine) every night, where you can share your experiences with others and make new friends.</p>
                <h4>Day 4</h4>
                <p>You’ll have another early morning to have time for a 1-hour bushwalk where you might view some of the smaller animals and experience more about the bush itself. Before bidding your farewell to the Kruger, you can eat breakfast at your camp after which you will be driven back to Johannesburg and dropped off at the airport.</p>
                <p>For an extra R1 500 per person, you can add a scenic drive through the Panorama Route to create even more memorable memories, , or with a 3 hour open-vehicle safari drive in a Big 5 reserve. During the optional Panorama Route tour on return trip to Johannesburg, you will stop at</p>
