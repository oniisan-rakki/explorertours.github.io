                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The Ann van Dyk Cheetah Centre was previously known as the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre. It is a captive breeding facility for South African cheetahs and other animals.</p>
                <p>The Ann van Dyk Cheetah Centre was the world’s first facility to breed captive cheetahs on a sustainable basis and the world’s first Cites-approved cheetah breeding facility. It is located in the Magaliesberg mountain range near Brits and the Hartbeespoort Dam in South Africa’s North West Province. The centre’s goal is to keep a viable genetic pool of cheetahs and African wild dogs (Africa’s second most endangered carnivore) for release back into their natural habitat. Other endangered species bred at the centre include the African wild cat, Suni, Blue and Red Duiker, Riverine Rabbit, and Vultures, including the extremely rare Egyptian Vulture. It was the first facility to reintroduce captive-born African wild dogs into their natural habitat successfully.</p>
                <p>Since its inception in 1971, the centre has given birth to over 600 cheetah cubs and over 500 wild dog pups. Here, the mystery of the King Cheetah was solved with the birth of the first King Cheetah in captivity. The Centre currently houses 78 cheetahs and 21 wild dogs. It also serves as a refuge for animals that have been illegally kept and confiscated. The facility successfully captured and relocated over sixty cheetahs considered “problem animals” through their Wild Cheetah Management Programme.</p>
                <p>As a result of this project and the implementation of “Cheetah Friendly” farmer boards, 240 thousand hectares of farmland have been converted into areas demonstrating that the cheetah and farmer can coexist.</p>
                <p>The Outreach Education Programme has reached an excess of 100 000 learners since its inception in 2003. It has impacted the hearts and minds of many young people who have chosen nature conservation as a career. The Ann van Dyk Cheetah Centre has been instrumental in assisting the government with developing policies for free-roaming cheetah management in South Africa over the last two years. The Centre is a non-profit organisation with income generated through tours, an adoption programme, donations and sponsorship. Every day, informative guided tours are available, allowing guests to drive through the cheetah and wild dog camps in an open safari vehicle.</p>
                <p>The cheetah run provides an opportunity to see a thrilling high-speed cheetah chase. A knowledgeable guide leads tours, and visitors to the centre will see various animals.</p>
                <p>The Centre has contributed to the survival and conservation of the cheetah through careful breeding (ensuring genetic diversity) and the release captive-born cheetahs as and when suitable space becomes available. It has also played an important role in academia, with eighty research publications written and conducted through the facility. The Ann Van Dyk Cheetah Centre does not provide ambassador interactions/touching to the general public.</p>
                <p>Note the age and height restrictions for children – no children younger than seven years or up to a height of 1.2m.</p>
