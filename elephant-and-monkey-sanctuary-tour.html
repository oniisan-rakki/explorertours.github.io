                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The Elephant and Monkey Sanctuaries have recently been merged into one stunning property.</p>
                <p>The Elephant Sanctuary has African elephants and offers an interactive elephant experience, while the monkey sanctuary’s goal is to allow them to live as they would in the wild.</p>
                <p>The property is one of several sanctuaries in a group of sanctuaries that provides for orphaned and abused animals.</p>
                <p>During this excursion, you can enjoy an interactive experience with Africa’s gentle giants on foot while you are guided and introduced to the elephants by a professional ranger.</p>
                <p>The elephants have been tamed through positive reinforcement animal management practices; therefore this is your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to interact, feed and witness African elephants in a natural environment.</p>
                <p>You will also have the opportunity to observe the unique bond that exists between the elephants and the people who are responsible for their care, and you will get more information during the tour about the elephants’ anatomy, their grooming routines, and the area in which they spend the night.</p>
                <p>A tour through the Bush babies and Monkey Sanctuary, situated west of the Elephant Sanctuary, is ideal for the family because you can see and learn more about free-living monkeys in a natural and wild environment.</p>
                <p>This natural sanctuary provides an environment where monkeys (primates) can enjoy their freedom in a natural environment. The sanctuary is located in one of the many gorges of the Magaliesberg mountain range and provides the picture-perfect environment for monkey species from all over the world.</p>
                <p>The Bushbaby and Monkey Sanctuary cover approximately 7 ha. It is one of only eight free-release primate sanctuaries in the world.</p>
                <p>It is privately owned and not subsidized by the government or anybody else. The primates are received as public donations and all of them are supported by funding that is generated by guided tours like these, and the sales of curios on the premises.</p>
                <p>Primates like a squirrel, spiders, and capuchin monkeys, often previously raised as household pets, or bred for the pet trade, can get a new lease on life here at the sanctuary.</p>
                <p>The monkeys are brought into a wild world that is filled with waterfalls, verdant greenery, natural mountain springs, and the opportunity to live in a setting that is as close to their natural habitat as possible.</p>
                <p>During a guided tour through the sanctuaries, guests will experience the splendor of our natural environment to the fullest.</p>

                <p>You will be introduced to the elephants in the forest area and allowed to touch and interact with them under the supervision of their care handlers.</p>
                <p>You can savor the special relationship that developed between the elephant handlers and their elephants and get the opportunity to walk trunk-in-hand with the elephants.</p>
                <p>You will visit the stables where the elephants sleep at night, and even feed the gentle giants. On hot days, you may witness the elephants swimming to cool off!</p>
