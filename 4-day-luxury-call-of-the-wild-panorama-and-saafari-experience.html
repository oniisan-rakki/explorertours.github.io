                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>This 4-day luxury safari at a budget price to the Kruger National Park, including the Panorama Route, is a fantastic way to experience the best of South Africa. The safari price is reasonable, all Kruger safaris are conducted in open safari vehicles, and the package offers a stay at the lovely Call of the Wild Lodge on the Hoedspruit Wildlife Estate, with breakfasts and dinners included.</p>
                <p><b>Accommodation</b></p>
                <p>The Call of the Wild Lodge is located in the Hoedspruit Wildlife estate near Hoedspruit, about 50 minutes from Orpen Gate to the Kruger National Park. Sunbird Suite, Kingfisher Corner,  African Hoopoe, and Hornbill Haven are the four luxurious rooms at the Call of the Wild Lodge. Sunbird Suite has two double rooms. Each room has either a king size bed or two single beds and can thus sleep four people. The unit shares a bathroom with a bath and a shower. The Kingfisher Corner is distinct from the main house with access through a private entrance from the parking lot. The room has a queen-sized bed, an en-suite bathroom with an outside shower. Hornbill Refuge has a king-size bed that can be converted to two single beds and an en-suite  bathroom with a bath only. The African Hoopoe room, like Kingfisher Corner, is separate from the main house and has a king-size bed as well as a single bed sleeper couch. There is an indoor and outdoor shower in the en-suite bathroom. All rooms have tea and coffee making equipment, a bar fridge, and a mosquito net.</p>
