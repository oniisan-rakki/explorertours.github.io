                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Big animals including elephants, rhinos, lions, and hippopotamuses can regularly be seen in the reserve. Between meals and game drives, visitors can unwind at the pool or go on guided walking safaris into the dense forest to observe the passing wildlife. Two daily game drives are offered in specialised 4×4 safari cars. The rangers would gladly share with you their extensive knowledge of everything that grows and lives in the area. Morning game drives take you deep into the Manyeleti concession and typically begin at half past five in the morning. You will pause the drive for a (much-needed) cup of coffee and some light fare.</p>
                <p>Honeyguide Mantobeni Tented Safari Camp provides a distinctive fusion of modern design elements with a traditional safari tent stay. In all, there are two camps—Khoka Moya and Mantobeni—each with twelve spacious tents. Each one has tasteful furnishings and sophisticated accents. The twelve East African-styled tents remind of a safari in the vein of Ernest Hemingway and provides visitors with a genuine safari experience, but unfortunately no children under 12 are allowed. The cosy furnishings in the tents feature soft leather couches, cotton sheets and damask linen, double or twin beds, and en suite bathrooms with a large concrete bath, double shower, and separate toilet. The main guest amenities include a bar, a temperature-controlled wine cellar, indoor and outdoor relaxation rooms, a reception area with a lounge and a small library. The swimming pool deck looks out over the waterhole and adjourns the public space.</p>
