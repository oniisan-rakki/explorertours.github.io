                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>On this 3-day glamping budget adventure in the Kruger National Park, you’ll get to experience the best of what Africa has to offer, all without breaking the bank. MoAfrika Tours has designed the most affordable Kruger Park package in the country, which has become extremely popular because a high standard of accommodation is provided at an exceptionally affordable rate.</p>
                <p>Located in the Motlala Reserve, the Sekekama Tented Camp delivers a budget glamping experience alongside the best that Kruger has to offer, with game drives conducted by our expert guides in open game viewing vehicles.  At the Motlala Reserve there is a wide variety of wildlife including leopard, hyena, and buffalos. You can also add a scenic Panorama Tour onto your return trip from your lodge back to OR Tambo International Airport if time permits.</p>
                <p>The Panorama Route is an adventurous route in Mpumalanga, passing the Blyde River Canyon, the world’s third largest canyon (and the largest green canyon).  Numerous waterfalls and one of South Africa’s largest forested regions are among the many natural attractions en route. This is an adventure you’ll never forget. So what are you waiting for?</p>
                <p><b>Accommodation</b></p>
                <p>Did somebody mention budget glamping accommodation in the Kruger? Then you can expect tents or cottages at Sekekama Tented Camp that are fully solar powered and furnished with beds, linens, towels, and other essentials, shared ablution facilities, a communal area for dining, socializing, and relaxing, game drives and even additional amenities such as a swimming pool, bar, or restaurant.</p>

            <!--What to Expect-->
            <div class="toursWhatToExpect">
                <h3>What to Expect</h3>
                <p>Experience the best of Africa on this 3-day budget glamping safari in Kruger National Park. Spend your days exploring the park on game drives, spotting the Big Five and other amazing wildlife. In the evenings, relax in your outfitted tented camp, enjoying delicious meals and stargazing under the African sky.</p>
                <p>Here is your itinerary for the 3-day budget glamping safari in Kruger:</p>
                <h4>Day 1 – Afternoon Sunset Drive</h4>
                <p>You will start this exciting safari early in the morning when you depart from OR Tambo International Airport and travel through the Highveld and Lowveld of Mpumalanga to arrive at Sekekama Tented Camp around 14:00. You will have time to refresh before the real adventure starts with an afternoon sunset game drive in an open safari vehicle through the Greater Kruger Blue Canyon Reserve.</p>
                <p>Keep your eyes peeled for the Big Five – lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos, and buffaloes – as well as other amazing wildlife such as giraffes, zebras, and hippos. Enjoy sundowners in the bush, then return to the camp to gather around the boma fire for dinner and stories about the day’s adventures.</p>
                <h4>Day 2 – Full Day Kruger</h4>
                <p>Your day may proceed in one of two ways: an early departure for Kruger National Park with a bush breakfast along the route and an earlier return, or having breakfast at the lodge first, departing and returning later. The exact departure times will be communicated to you the night before as it will be decided according to animal activity at the time to give you the best opportunity for game viewing.</p>
                <p>Your safari in Kruger will last about 7 to 8 hours, during which you will venture deep into the Orpen-Satara area, where your chances of seeing lions are better than anywhere else in the park. You will return to the camp with ample time to unwind and get ready for a starlit dinner around the fire.</p>
                <h4>Day 3 – Bush Walk or Sunset Drive</h4>
                <p>Your day will start early again, this time with an optional 1-hour bushwalk before breakfast OR an optional 3 hour sunset drive for R1250 per person sharing, in Blue Canyon, Greater Kruger. After breakfast it is time for good-byes and your return to Johannesburg.</p>
                <p>But don’t despair, you have the option to stretch the adventure a little longer by taking the scenic Panorama Route back, at an additional cost of R1 995 per person sharing (minimum 2 people).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Subject to availability</li>

                <p>This route will take you past Berlin Falls, God’s Window, Blyde Canyon, and Three Rondavels before you finally leave the Lowveld. You should arrive back at OR Tambo International Airport not later than around 17:00 or 18:00.</p>
